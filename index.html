        Hello, I'm Owyn Neville, a freshman studying Information Technology at Michigan Tech. <br>
        Technology has always been a big part of my life, and over the years I’ve developed a strong interest in the hardware side of
        IT. Building my own computers, experimenting with different operating systems, and putting together outdated technology.
        <br>
        I currently work as a IT Classroom Support Specialist for Michigan Tech IT,
        supporting technology across classrooms throughout campus.
        The role has given me hands-on experience troubleshooting real issues, working with a wide range of equipment,
        and making sure students and faculty have the technology and information they need to teach and learn effectively.
        <br> <br>Some of my best skills include:
    </p>
    <ul id = "skills">
        <li>IT Support</li>
        <li>IT Operational Testing</li>
        <li>Computer Repair</li>
        <li>Customer Service</li>
        <li>Javascript</li>
        <li>Configuring Computers with Enterprise Systems.</li>
        <li>Configurating Windows, MacOS, Linux</li>
    </ul>
